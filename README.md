# -Fashion-Recommender-System-with-ResNet50
This fashion recommendation system utilizes the powerful ResNet50 convolutional neural network to extract visual features from fashion images, enabling similarity-Fashion Recommendation System with ResNet50
Overview
This project uses ResNet50 (a pre-trained CNN) to extract visual features from fashion images and then recommends similar items using KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors). It is hosted with Streamlit for a web-based interface, while TensorFlow and Jupyter Notebooks are used for training and experimentation.

Technologies
ResNet50: Feature extraction from images.
KNN: Similarity-based recommendation algorithm.
TensorFlow: For deep learning and model training.
Streamlit: Web hosting of the app.
Jupyter Notebooks: For model developmentN
